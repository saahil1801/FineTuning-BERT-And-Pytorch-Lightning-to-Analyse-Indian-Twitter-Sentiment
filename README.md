# Using-BERT-Pytorch-Lightning-to-Analyse-Twitter-Sentiment

This repository contains a PyTorch Lightning implementation for sentiment classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model is trained and evaluated on Twitter data for sentiment analysis.

## Model Architecture

The sentiment classification model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). It consists of a pre-trained BERT model followed by a dropout layer and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification.

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on Twitter data for sentiment analysis. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure consistent label mapping.
